    "# Assignment 2:  Unlocking Statistical Insights with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you'll dive into the world of statistical analysis using Python.  We'll move beyond theoretical concepts and focus on practical application. You'll learn how to calculate key statistical measures and use them for real-world tasks like outlier detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment will guide you through:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Revise the concepts and equations:**  You'll implement code from scratch to compute essential statistics like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range (IQR).\n",
    "* **Calculating Basic Statistics:**  You'll implement code from scratch to compute essential statistics like mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range (IQR).\n",
    "* **Explore some liberaries**: Optionaly use powerful libraries like NumPy and SciPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### General Instructions \n",
    "\n",
    "Please adhere to the following guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Clarity:** Your code should be well-formatted, easy to understand, and include meaningful variable names.\n",
    "- **Docstrings:**  Use docstrings to document your functions and explain their purpose, arguments, and return values.\n",
    "- **Testing:**  Use the same given data example of your code to demonstrate its functionality.\n",
    "- **NOTE:** Answer in the same notebook with the given examples."
